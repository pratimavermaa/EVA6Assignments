**Assignment A:**
1.	Download this  TINY IMAGENET dataset. 
2.	Train ResNet18 on this dataset (70/30 split) for 50 Epochs. Target 50%+ Validation Accuracy. 
3.	Submit Results. Of course, you are using your own package for everything. You can look at  this  for reference. 

**Assignment B:**
1.	Download this   downloadfile. Learn how COCO object detection dataset's schema is. This file has the same schema. You'll need to discover what those number are. 
2.	Identify these things for this dataset:
1.	readme data for class distribution (along with the class names) along with a graph 
2.	Calculate the Anchor Boxes for k = 3, 4, 5, 6 and draw them.
3.	Share the calculations for both via a notebook uploaded on your GitHub Repo
 
**Questions in S10-Assignment-Solution:**
1.	Share the final 4-5 log data showing your validation/test accuracy (don't redirect to any page, you'll get 0).
2.	Describe the data augmentation strategy that you used in points. Then copy page the augmentation/transformation code here (don't redirect to any page, you'll get 0).
3.	Share the link to your repo where you are storing your model.py file (cannot be the same as the repo for this assignment submission).
4.	Share the link to this assignment's repo where we can find the code for TinyImageNet Resnet and the code for calculation of K-means (these can be different if you want).
5.	Share the link to README for k-means assignment.
6.	Share the image showing your BBOXes based on your calculations for all the Ks, and describe them.
